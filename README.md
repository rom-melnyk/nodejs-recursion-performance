# Recursion: performance analysis

There are several implementaions of Fibonacci algorithm compared:

- classic recirsive implementation,
- recursive with [tail call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call) optimization,
- recursive with memoization,
- classic loop (as "placebo control").

Results follow.
